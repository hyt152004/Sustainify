Welcome to Sustainify, where sustainability meets daily life! Whether it's reducing waste, conserving energy, or embracing sustainable practices, we inspire positive change, one challenge at a time. Our inspiration for Sustainify stemmed from a desire to encourage users to engage in daily challenges, fostering a sense of accomplishment and improvement over time in keeping a eco friendly environment! Sustainify generates three challenges for users to complete daily. Upon completion, users can mark off their achievements, gradually enhancing their ranking. We utilized React for the development of Sustainify and integrated the OpenAI API to generate prompts for daily challenges!
